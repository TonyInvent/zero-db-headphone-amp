# zero-db-headphone-amp
A zero output resistance zero db headphone amp

## Value Changes
For OPA1622 schematic, please change the resistor in series with 1.2nF cap from 100 Ohm to 800 Ohm or 1K Ohm. Please change two capcitors from 1nF to 200p. 
change reason: to reduce the phase delay (20Hz to 20KHz). 20KHz phase delay is less than 1.6 deg after changes applied.
